To get faster, you must see what "Fast" looks like. Let's analyze a typical Pro Solve.

## The Scramble
`D2 F2 U' B2 U L2 D R2 U' B' L U B' D L F R2 B2 D'`

## The "Pro" Thought Process (Sub-5s)

### 1. Inspection (0s - 8s)
*   **Pro:** "Okay, White cross... I see Green and Red are already connected. Blue is one move away. I can insert Orange while aligning Green. I also see the Red/Blue corner and edge are going to end up in the top layer."
*   **You:** "Where is the white piece? Found one."

### 2. Cross (0.5s)
*   **Pro:** Executes 5 moves in 0.4 seconds. `x2 D R' D L F'`. Fingers a blur.
*   **You:** `R... U...` wait, where did the green go?

### 3. F2L Pair 1 (1.2s)
*   **Pro:** Already tracked the Red/Blue pair during the cross. Instantly goes into `U R U' R'`.
*   **You:** Rotates cube 3 times looking for pieces.

### 4. F2L Pair 2 (Keyhole)
*   **Pro:** Sees Orange/Green corner is solved. Uses D-move to insert the edge via Keyhole.
*   **You:** Takes the corner out, pairs it, puts it back in. (8 moves vs 4 moves).

### 5. Last Layer (1.5s)
*   **Pro:** Recognizes OLL case #34 instantly. Executes. Predicts PLL is a J-Perm. Pre-AUFs (Adjust U Face). Bang. Timer stops.
*   **You:** "Is that Sune? No wait, Anti-Sune. Let me twist it to check."

## What to learn from this?
1.  **Efficiency:** The Pro didn't turn *faster* in F2L; they turned *less*.
2.  **Continuity:** The Pro never stopped to look. They looked *while* solving.
3.  **Plan the Cross:** Don't just find one piece. Plan all 4.
