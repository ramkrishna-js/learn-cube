Competitions are 10% skill and 90% nerve management. Here is how to handle the pressure.

## 1. The "Nervous Shakes"
It happens to everyone. Your hands shake uncontrollably.
*   **The Fix:** Warm up! Bring hand warmers. Cold hands = stiff fingers = shaking.
*   **Breathing:** Before the solve, take a deep "Box Breath" (In 4s, Hold 4s, Out 4s).

## 2. Zone of Focus
The venue is loud. Kids are screaming. Timers are beeping.
*   **Wear Earmuffs:** You are allowed to wear noise-canceling earmuffs (not headphones with music!).
*   **Tunnel Vision:** Look only at your cube. Don't look at the judge. Don't look at the guy next to you solving in 5 seconds.

## 3. Incident Management
What if something goes wrong?
*   **Timer didn't stop?** Don't touch the cube! Call a delegate immediately.
*   **Distraction?** If a kid bumps your table mid-solve, STOP. Raise your hand. You might get an extra attempt.
*   **Pop?** Put it back in and keep going. If you can't find the piece, it's a DNF.

## 4. The "Comp PB" Trap
Don't try to beat your Personal Best at a competition.
*   **Goal:** Aim for your *average* time.
*   If you average 20s at home, be happy with a 21s average at comp. The nerves add time.

## 5. Judge Etiquette
*   The judge is a volunteer (usually another competitor). Be nice.
*   **Wait** until they say "Ready" before placing your hands.
*   **Sign** the scoresheet only after checking the time.
