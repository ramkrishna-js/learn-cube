Welcome to the secret language of cubers. Use these terms to sound like a pro, even if your average is 2 minutes.

## A

### Algorithm (Algo)
A sequence of moves to achieve a specific result.
*Usage:* "I forgot the algo and now my cube is a salad."

### AUF (Adjust U Face)
The final flick of the top layer to align the colors after finishing an algorithm.
*Reality:* The move you forget to do when stopping the timer, resulting in a +2 penalty.

## C

### Corner Twist
1. A physical state where a corner piece flips in place, making the cube unsolvable.
2. The act of physically twisting it back when no one is looking. (We saw you.)

### CFOP
Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL. The method everyone tells you to learn.

## D

### DNF (Did Not Finish)
When something goes wrong during a solve in competition.
*Emotional Translation:* Pain. Suffering. Why do I do this?

## F

### Finger Tricks
Using specific fingers to flick layers instead of grabbing the whole cube with your hand like a sandwich.

## L

### Lookahead
The ability to see what you need to do next while your hands are busy doing the current thing.
*Expectation:* Jedi foresight.
*Reality:* Staring blankly at the cube for 3 seconds between moves.

## M

### Main
The cube you trust with your life. The one you bring to competitions.

### Maglev
Using repelling magnets instead of springs. Because friction is so 2020.

## N

### Non-Cuber (Muggle)
Someone who says, "I just peel the stickers off" or "My cousin can solve it in 2 seconds." (Spoiler: They can't).

## P

### PB (Personal Best)
Your fastest time ever.
*Note:* It usually happens when no one is watching and you definitely didn't scramble it properly.

### Pop
When a piece flies out of the cube mid-solve. It turns a speedcube into a projectile weapon.

## R

### Regrip
Changing your hand position on the cube. Too many regrips = slow.
*Goal:* Be like an octopus. Never let go.

## S

### Sub-X
"Sub" means "Under".
*   **Sub-20:** You average under 20 seconds.
*   **Sub-Minute:** You average under 60 seconds.
*   **Sub-way:** A sandwich shop. Don't eat your cube.

## T

### TPS (Turns Per Second)
How fast your fingers fly. High TPS + Bad Lookahead = Solving the wrong thing very quickly.

## Z

### Z-Perm
A PLL case where two pairs of edges need to swap.
*Why is it funny?* Because everyone hates recognizing it.
