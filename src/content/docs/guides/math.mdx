## How many combinations?
A 3x3 cube has **43,252,003,274,489,856,000** possible positions.
*   That is 43 quintillion.
*   If you had 43 quintillion cubes, you could cover the surface of the Earth 275 times.

## God's Number
What is the maximum number of moves required to solve ANY scramble?
*   For years, people thought it was 52, then 42, then 30.
*   In 2010, Google computers proved it: **20 moves**.
*   This means *every* state can be solved in 20 moves or less (Half-Turn Metric).

## Commutators (The Secret Sauce)
Most advanced algorithms are built using **Commutators**.
A commutator is a sequence in the form: `A B A' B'`

### Why do they work?
Imagine you have a solved cube.
1.  **A:** You make a change (e.g., twist a corner). This "breaks" other things.
2.  **B:** You move that corner away and replace it with another corner.
3.  **A':** You undo the first move. This "fixes" the broken things, but now applies the reverse twist to the new corner.
4.  **B':** You undo the second move.

*Result:* Only those two corners are affected. Everything else is solved.

### Example: Corner Cycle
Try this: `(R U R') D (R U' R') D'`
*   **A:** `R U R'` (Inserts a corner)
*   **B:** `D` (Moves the bottom layer)
*   **A':** `R U' R'` (Undoes the insertion)
*   **B':** `D'` (Undoes the bottom move)

This cycles 3 corners without messing up the rest of the cube. This is the basis of **Blindfolded Solving**.

## Parity (The Math Error)
Parity isn't a glitch; it's a mathematical property.
*   **Even Cubes (4x4):** You can swap two edges without swapping corners. This is impossible on a 3x3 because of the way permutations work (even vs odd permutations).
*   On a 3x3, every turn swaps a set of corners AND a set of edges. You cannot swap just two pieces.
