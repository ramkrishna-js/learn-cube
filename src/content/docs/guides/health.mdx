Speedcubing is an e-sport. And like all sports, you can get injured. (Stop laughing, it's true).
Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) is the arch-nemesis of the speedcuber.

## The Injuries

### 1. Cuber's Thumb
*   **Symptoms:** Pain at the base of the thumb.
*   **Cause:** Spamming spacebar on the timer, or gripping the cube too hard during OH (One-Handed).
*   **Fix:** Stop cubing for 2 days. Use a lighter cube (weaker magnets).

### 2. Nintendinitis (Wrist Pain)
*   **Symptoms:** Shooting pain in the wrist or forearm.
*   **Cause:** Turning with your wrist instead of your fingers.
*   **Fix:** Learn proper **Finger Tricks**. Your wrists should be mostly stationary.

### 3. The "Claw" Cramp
*   **Symptoms:** Hand stuck in a claw shape.
*   **Cause:** Tension. You are holding the cube like it owes you money.
*   **Fix:** Relax your grip. The cube should rest in your hands, not be strangled by them.

## The Stretches (Do these!)

### The Prayer
Put palms together in front of your chest. Lower them until you feel a stretch in your forearms. Hold for 15s.

### The Reverse Prayer
Put backs of hands together. Lower elbows. Feel the weird stretch.

### The Piano
Shake your hands out loosely like you are trying to dry them without a towel. loosen up the fingers.

## Eye Strain
*   **The Problem:** Staring at bright stickers for 4 hours.
*   **The Fix:** The "20-20-20 Rule". Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. (No, looking at a different cube doesn't count).

## Mental Health
*   **The Rage Quit:** Throwing a cube is expensive. Don't do it.
*   **The Plateau:** You will get stuck at a certain time (e.g., 25 seconds) for months. This is normal. Take a break.
