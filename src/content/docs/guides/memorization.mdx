You look at a PLL sheet. There are 21 algorithms. Some are 15 moves long. You want to quit.
Don't quit. Here is how to memorize them without brute force.

## 1. Do NOT memorize letters
If you try to memorize "R U R prime U prime R prime F...", you will fail.
Your brain cannot hold 15 random letters.
**Memorize Triggers.**

### What is a Trigger?
A trigger is a short sequence of 3-4 moves that your hand does automatically.
*   **Sexy Move:** `R U R' U'` (The most common trigger).
*   **Sledgehammer:** `R' F R F'`
*   **Insertion:** `R U R'` or `R U' R'`

### Example: The T-Perm
Instead of memorizing: `R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'` (14 moves).
Break it down into triggers:
1.  **Sexy Move:** `(R U R' U')`
2.  **Sledge-down:** `(R' F)`
3.  **Double Up:** `(R2 U')`
4.  **Sexy-ish:** `(R' U' R U)`
5.  **Finish:** `(R' F')`

Now it's just 5 "chunks" instead of 14 letters.

## 2. Visual Tracking
Don't look at the notation. Look at the **Pairs**.
*   *Example:* In the **F2L** algorithm `R U' R'`, watch the White/Red/Blue corner.
*   See it go up (`R`), move over (`U'`), and go back down (`R'`).
*   Your brain remembers the *path* of the piece better than the letter.

## 3. Muscle Memory (The Holy Grail)
Eventually, you stop thinking "Sexy Move". You just think "T-Perm" and your hands do the rest.
*   **How to get there:** Repetition.
*   **The Drill:** Perform an algorithm. Repeat it. Repeat it 50 times while watching Netflix.
*   **The Test:** Can you do the algorithm while talking to someone? If yes, it is in muscle memory.

## 4. Nicknames
Give algorithms names.
*   **"The Phone Number":** A specific OLL that looks like a dialing pattern.
*   **"Mario":** An alg that jumps a piece over another.
*   **"Kill the Lights":** An OLL where you flip edges to "turn off" the yellow stickers.

## 5. Sleep
Your brain wires muscle memory while you sleep.
*   If you practice an alg for 1 hour, you might still suck at it.
*   Wake up the next morning, and suddenly your hands know it perfectly.
*   *Science.*
