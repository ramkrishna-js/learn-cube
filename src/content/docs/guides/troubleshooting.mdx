Sometimes you follow the instructions perfectly, but the cube simply won't solve. You might have an "Impossible State".

## 1. The Corner Twist
**Symptom:** You solve the entire cube, but one single corner is twisted the wrong way.
**Cause:** You (or a friend) physically twisted a corner piece while the cube was scrambled.
**Fix:**
1.  Turn the layer 45 degrees.
2.  Physically grab the corner and twist it back to the solved position.
*   *Note:* It is mathematically impossible to have just **one** corner twisted. They always come in pairs (one clockwise, one counter-clockwise). If only one is wrong, it was physically twisted.

## 2. The Popped Edge (Parity?)
**Symptom:** You are doing the last layer, but you have an odd number of yellow edges (e.g., 1 or 3).
**Cause:** The cube popped (fell apart) and was put back together wrong.
**Fix:**
1.  Pry out the incorrect edge piece.
2.  Flip it over.
3.  Push it back in.

## 3. Swapped Centers
**Symptom:** The centers are in the wrong order (e.g., Yellow next to White).
**Cause:** You took the caps off or disassembled the core and put it back wrong.
**Fix:**
*   You must disassemble the cube and reassemble it with the standard color scheme:
    *   White opposite Yellow
    *   Blue opposite Green
    *   Red opposite Orange
    *   *Remember:* **Blue-Orange-Yellow** go clockwise around a corner.

## 4. "I'm just stuck"
**Symptom:** You messed up an algorithm and now everything is chaos.
**Fix:**
1.  Don't panic.
2.  Go back to the **White Cross** step.
3.  Re-solve it layer by layer.
4.  Do not try to "undo" your moves; it rarely works. Just start fresh.
