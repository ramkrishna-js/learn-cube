Before 2017, if you wanted a magnetic cube, you had to build it yourself. Today, almost all cubes come magnetic, but modding is still a fun hobby.

## Magnetizing a Cube
Have an old cube lying around? Give it superpowers.

### Tools Needed
*   **N48 or N35 Neodymium Magnets:** Size 4x2mm is standard.
*   **Superglue:** Gel type is best (doesn't run).
*   **Tweezers:** Unless you have tiny fingers.

### The Process
1.  **Disassemble:** Take the cube apart completely.
2.  **Open Pieces:** Split the edges and corners open (most pry apart).
3.  **Placement:**
    *   You need to glue magnets inside the pieces so they attract when the cube is aligned.
    *   **Crucial:** Check polarity! If you glue them repelling, your cube will push itself apart.
4.  **Glue:** A tiny drop. Drop the magnet in. Let it dry.
5.  **Reassemble:** Enjoy the satisfying *click*.

## Spring Swaps (MagLev Mod)
You can turn a spring cube into a MagLev cube.
1.  Buy "Ring Magnets" that fit over the screw.
2.  Remove the metal spring.
3.  Put two magnets on the screw, facing each other so they **repel**.
4.  Screw it back in. The floating magnets act like a frictionless spring.

## Sticker Mods
*   **Force Cubes:** Buy 6 stickerless cubes of the same model. Take them apart. Assemble 6 new cubes that are SOLID colors (all red, all blue, etc.).
*   **Calendar Cube:** Stickers with dates. You have to "solve" it to show today's date.
*   **Mirror Blocks:** Shape-shifting puzzles where pieces are different sizes but same color.
