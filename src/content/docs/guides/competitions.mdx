So you want to compete. You've signed up on the [WCA (World Cube Association)](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org) website. Now what?

## The Vibe
Competitions are surprisingly chill. It's 90% hanging out and 10% solving. Everyone is friendly. You will see 10-year-olds solving in 6 seconds. Do not be intimidated. They are the future; accept it.

## The Rules (The Important Ones)

### 1. The Inspection
When you sit down, you get **15 seconds** to look at the cube.
*   You can pick it up.
*   You **cannot** make any moves.
*   If you go over 15 seconds, you get a **+2 second penalty**.
*   If you go over 17 seconds, it's a **DNF** (Did Not Finish).

### 2. The Timer (Stackmat)
You don't use a keyboard. You use a touch-sensitive mat.
1.  Place both hands flat on the sensors (palms down).
2.  Wait for the light to go **Green**.
3.  Lift hands -> Solve -> Drop hands.
4.  **DO NOT TOUCH THE CUBE** after stopping the timer until the judge says okay.

### 3. The +2 Penalty
You get 2 seconds added to your time if:
*   You start the timer too early.
*   The cube is not fully solved (misaligned by more than 45 degrees) when you stop.

### 4. Flash Photography
**Strictly banned.** It blinds the competitors. Don't be that person.

## The Process
1.  **Runner** calls your name.
2.  You submit your cube to the **Scrambling Table**.
3.  You wait in the waiting area (nervously).
4.  **Judge** calls you to a station.
5.  Judge covers the cube, asks "Ready?".
6.  You say "Yes", they lift the cover. Inspection starts.
7.  You solve.
8.  You both sign the score sheet. **CHECK THE TIME BEFORE SIGNING.** Once you sign, it's final.

## Etiquette
*   Don't talk to someone while they are solving.
*   Don't scream if you get a bad time.
*   Do scream (politely) if you get a World Record.
*   Shower. Please. It's a small room with lots of people.
