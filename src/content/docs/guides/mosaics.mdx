Who needs paint when you have plastic? Cube Mosaics are pixel art created by arranging hundreds of Rubik's Cubes.

## How it works
1.  **Pixel Art:** Treat each face of a 3x3 cube as a 3x3 grid of pixels.
2.  **Resolution:** 
    *   100 cubes = 10x10 grid of cubes = 30x30 pixels (900 pixels).
    *   This is enough for a decent face portrait.
3.  **Palette:** You have 6 colors: White, Yellow, Red, Orange, Blue, Green.

## Building one
You don't need to speedsolve. You just need to solve one face.

1.  **Design:** Use a tool (like "Twizzle" or "Mosaic Builder") to convert an image into 6 colors.
2.  **Scramble:** The tool gives you a scramble for *each* cube to generate the specific pattern on the front face.
3.  **Assemble:** Stack them up.

## The Cost
*   **Cheap Cubes:** Do not buy 100 GAN cubes ($6000).
*   **Bulk Buying:** You can buy "Mosaic Sets" (usually slightly smaller, cheaper cubes) for ~$1-2 per cube.

## Famous Mosaics
*   **Rubik's Cube on a Rubik's Cube:** Very meta.
*   **Portraits:** Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, and famous YouTubers.
*   **QR Codes:** Yes, you can make a scanable QR code. (Don't link it to a Rickroll, please).
