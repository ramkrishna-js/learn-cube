We live in the future. Cubes now have batteries, gyroscopes, and Bluetooth.

## What is a Smart Cube?
It looks like a normal speedcube, but it connects to your phone/tablet.
*   **Real-time tracking:** The app mimics your moves on screen instantly.
*   **Stats:** It measures your TPS (Turns Per Second), rotations, and pauses.
*   **Battles:** You can race people online.

## Why get one?
### 1. The "Stats Nerd" Reason
It breaks down your solve.
*   *"You took 3.2 seconds to recognize the OLL."*
*   *"You rotated the cube 4 times during Cross."*
*   This feedback is invaluable for improvement.

### 2. The Beginner Reason
Some apps (like the **GAN Cube Station** or **GoCube**) teach you to solve interactively. If you make a mistake, the app tells you exactly how to fix it. No more reading confusing diagrams.

## The Top Models
1.  **GAN 12 UI / i3:** The gold standard. Feels like a real speedcube. Expensive.
2.  **Moyu WeiLong AI:** Very fast, good battery life.
3.  **GoCube / Rubik's Connected:** Good for beginners, but the shape is weird (rounded corners). Not great for speed.

## The Downsides
*   **Charging:** You have to charge your cube. That feels weird.
*   **Weight:** They are usually heavier than normal cubes due to electronics.
*   **Not WCA Legal:** You cannot use them in official competitions (yet).
