These are the names you need to know. The people who pushed the limits of human potential.

## The Modern Era

### Max Park (USA)
The machine.
*   **Status:** The GOAT (Greatest of All Time).
*   **Records:** Holds the 3x3 Single World Record (3.13 seconds) and almost every 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, and 7x7 record.
*   **Style:** Brutal turning speed (TPS) and flawless lookahead. He doesn't use many fancy tricks; he just turns faster than anyone else.

### Yiheng Wang (China)
The prodigy.
*   **Age:** Literally a child (born ~2014).
*   **Skill:** Consistently averages sub-5 seconds.
*   **Impact:** Represents the new generation of "Smart Cube" kids who grew up with AI trainers.

### Feliks Zemdegs (Australia)
The legend.
*   **Impact:** Dominated cubing from 2010 to 2020.
*   **Records:** Has broken over 100 World Records.
*   **Why he matters:** He popularized CFOP and created the resources that taught everyone else. Without Feliks, there is no Max Park.

### Tymon Kolasiński (Poland)
The efficiency master.
*   **Style:** Uses very few moves. He is slower at turning but smarter at planning.
*   **Method:** A highly optimized version of CFOP with pseudo-slotting and ZBLL.

## The Pioneers

### Minh Thai (USA)
*   **Achievement:** Won the first World Championship in 1982.
