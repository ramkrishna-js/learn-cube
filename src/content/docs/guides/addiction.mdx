If you are reading this, it is likely too late for you. But for educational purposes, here is the clinical progression of the Speedcubing Virus.

## Stage 1: Curiosity
You see a YouTube video of a kid solving a cube in 5 seconds.
*   **Thought:** "That's impossible. It's fake."
*   **Action:** You buy a $3 Rubik's brand from the grocery store.
*   **Result:** You scramble it. You cry.

## Stage 2: The First Solve
You find a tutorial (maybe this one!). You spend 3 hours sweating over "The White Cross".
*   **The Moment:** You finish the last layer. The colors align. Dopamine floods your brain.
*   **Symptom:** You run to your mom/spouse/cat and scream "LOOK! I DID IT!"
*   **Response:** They do not care.

## Stage 3: The Upgrade
You realize your store-bought cube turns like a rusty toaster.
*   **Action:** You buy a $10 magnetic speedcube (RS3M).
*   **Result:** It turns so fast it flies out of your hands. You realize you have been living a lie.

## Stage 4: The Algorithm Grinding
You decide you want to be "Fast".
*   **Symptom:** You are muttering "R U R prime" under your breath at the dinner table.
*   **Physical Change:** Your thumbs develop calluses. Your wrists click.
*   **Social Impact:** Your friends stop inviting you to places because you bring the cube.

## Stage 5: G.A.S. (Gear Acquisition Syndrome)
You own 15 3x3s. They all look identical.
*   **Logic:** "But this one has *MagLev*! And *Purple Internals*!"
*   **Reality:** You are still averaging 25 seconds, but now you are doing it on a $90 piece of plastic.

## Stage 6: The "Non-Cuber" Interaction
Someone sees you solving in public.
*   **Them:** "I used to solve that by peeling the stickers."
*   **You (Internal Monologue):** *Don't kill them. Don't kill them.*
*   **You (Out Loud):** "Haha, yeah, that works too."

## Stage 7: Acceptance
You have accepted your fate. You judge people by their PB. You know what "Z-Perm" means. You are one of us.
