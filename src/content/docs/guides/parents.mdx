So, your child has asked for a speedcube. Or maybe they are already turning one constantly, creating a clicking noise that haunts your dreams. Do not panic. This is a good hobby.

## Is my child a genius?
*   **The honest answer:** Maybe, but solving a cube is not an IQ test. It is a test of **memory**, **pattern recognition**, and **patience**.
*   Any child can learn to solve it. It teaches them that "impossible" problems can be broken down into small, solvable steps. This is a life skill.

## What should I buy?
**DO NOT buy a Rubik's Brand cube from a toy store.**
*   They are stiff, hard to turn, and non-adjustable. Your child will get frustrated.
*   **The Upgrade:** Buy a "Speedcube" online. They cost roughly the same ($10-$15) but turn effortlessly.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   *Budget:* MoYu RS3M V5 (~$10).
    *   *Nice:* QiYi M Pro (~$15).
    *   *Gift:* GAN 356 M (~$25).

## "They took it apart and can't fix it!"
*   This is normal. Speedcubes are designed to be disassembled.
*   **The Fix:** Search "How to assemble a 3x3" on YouTube. It takes 5 minutes. Do not throw it away.

## Competition Etiquette (For Parents)
If you take them to a competition (WCA):
1.  **Do not stand next to them.** They need to focus. Stand in the audience area.
2.  **Do not use flash photography.** It is banned.
3.  **Be patient.** Comps are long days. Bring a book.
4.  **Celebrate the average.** Don't ask "Did you win?" (They won't, Max Park will). Ask "Did you beat your personal best?"

## The Noise
*   Yes, the clicking is annoying.
*   **Pro Tip:** Buy a "Lube" (lubricant). It dampens the sound significantly.
