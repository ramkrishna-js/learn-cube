## Myth 1: "You have to be good at Math."
**False.**
Solving a Rubik's Cube requires zero math. It requires:
1.  **Pattern Recognition:** "Oh look, a red block."
2.  **Muscle Memory:** "My fingers know what to do."
*   *Truth:* There is deep math *behind* the cube (Group Theory), but you don't need to know how an engine works to drive a car.

## Myth 2: "I peeled the stickers off."
**Verdict:** We hate you.
*   *Why:* It ruins the cube. Also, modern cubes are stickerless (colored plastic), so you can't peel them. Checkmate, cheaters.

## Myth 3: "You memorize the solution."
**Misleading.**
We don't memorize 43 quintillion moves. We memorize a **Method**.
*   It's like driving home. You don't memorize every inch of asphalt. You memorize "Turn Left at the gas station."

## Myth 4: "Speedcubes are cheating."
**False.**
"Using a good tennis racket is cheating." "Using running shoes is cheating."
*   *Truth:* A speedcube allows you to turn as fast as your brain can think. A Rubik's brand prevents you from turning at all.

## Myth 5: "Smart people solve it fast."
**False.**
*   *Truth:* **Obsessive** people solve it fast. A genius who practices 1 hour will lose to an average person who practices 100 hours.
