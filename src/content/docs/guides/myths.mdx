## Myth 1: "You have to be good at Math."
**False.**
Solving a Rubik's Cube requires zero math. It requires:
1.  **Pattern Recognition:** "Oh look, a red block."
2.  **Muscle Memory:** "My fingers know what to do."
*   *Truth:* There is deep math *behind* the cube (Group Theory), but you don't need to know how an engine works to drive a car.

## Myth 2: "I peeled the stickers off."
**Verdict:** We hate you.
*   *Why:* It ruins the cube. Also, modern cubes are stickerless (colored plastic), so you can't peel them. Checkmate, cheaters.

## Myth 3: "You memorize the solution."
**Misleading.**
We don't memorize 43 quintillion moves. We memorize a **Method**.
*   It's like driving home. You don't memorize every inch of asphalt. You memorize "Turn Left at the gas station."

## Myth 4: "Speedcubes are cheating."
**False.**
"Using a good tennis racket is cheating." "Using running shoes is cheating."
*   *Truth:* A speedcube allows you to turn as fast as your brain can think. A Rubik's brand prevents you from turning at all.

## Myth 5: "Smart people solve it fast."
**False.**
*   *Truth:* **Obsessive** people solve it fast. A genius who practices 1 hour will lose to an average person who practices 100 hours.

## Myth 6: "The 10x10 must be impossible."
**False.**
If you can solve a 5x5, you can solve a 10x10, a 19x19, or a 100x100.
*   *Reality:* It's not harder; it's just **boring**. It takes 2 hours of doing the exact same thing over and over. It's a test of bladder control, not skill.

## Myth 7: "My cube fell apart! It's broken!"
**False.**
It's not a vase. It's a mechanical puzzle held together by tension.
*   *The Fix:* Pick up the pieces. Watch a YouTube video. Pop them back in.
*   *Pro Tip:* If a piece breaks in half (snapped plastic), *then* it's broken. If it just fell out, it's a "Pop".

## Myth 8: "I need an $80 GAN Cube to be fast."
**Marketing Lie.**
A $10 MoYu RS3M V5 is capable of breaking the World Record.
*   *Analogy:* Buying a Ferrari won't make you a Formula 1 driver if you don't know how to drive.
*   *Reality:* Get sub-20 seconds on a cheap cube first. Then buy the expensive one as a reward.

## Myth 9: "Lube is cheating."
**Physics says no.**
Friction creates heat and wear. Lube reduces friction.
*   *Why we use it:* To make the cube turn smoothly and to prevent the plastic from grinding itself into dust.
*   *Side effect:* It makes you faster.

## Myth 10: "I'm too old to learn."
**Excuse.**
While kids have "neuroplasticity" (fancy word for learning fast), adults have **Discipline**.
*   *Fact:* There are competitive cubers in their 50s, 60s, and 80s.
*   *Benefit:* It keeps your brain sharp and fights off mental decline.
