From 2004 to 2019, **3x3 With Feet** was an official WCA event.
Yes. People sat on the floor, took off their shoes, and solved the cube with their toes.

## How it worked
*   **The Timer:** Placed on the floor.
*   **The Technique:** Use big toes for `U` and `D` moves. Use the side of the foot for `R` and `L` moves.
*   **The Speed:** The World Record was **16.96 seconds**. (Faster than most people can solve with hands).

## Why was it banned?
1.  **Hygiene:** Do you want to touch a timer after someone's sweaty gym feet were on it? No.
2.  **Logistics:** Judges didn't want to smell feet all day.
3.  **Participation:** Very few people practiced it because... well, it's gross.

## The Legacy
It remains a meme in the community. If you see someone solving with their feet today, they are likely an "Old School" cuber paying respects to the fallen event.
