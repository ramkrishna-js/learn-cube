## 1974: The Beginning
Hungarian architecture professor **Ernő Rubik** wanted a way to explain 3D geometry to his students. He built a wooden prototype held together by rubber bands.
*   **Fun Fact:** It took Ernő **one month** to solve his own invention for the first time.

## 1980: The Craze
The "Magic Cube" was renamed "Rubik's Cube" and hit the West. It exploded.
*   Every kid had one.
*   There were cartoons.
*   There were books.
*   People got "Cuber's Thumb" (RSI).

## 1982: The First Championship
Held in Budapest. The winner was **Minh Thai** with a time of **22.95 seconds**.
*   *Perspective:* Today's world record is **3.13 seconds**. The robots are even faster.

## 2000s: The Internet Era
The cube died out in the 90s but returned with the internet.
*   People started sharing algorithms online.
*   The **WCA** (World Cube Association) was founded in 2004.
*   Patents expired, leading to better "Speedcubes" from China (DaYan, MoYu, GAN).

## Today
Cubing is a global e-sport.
*   **Netflix:** "The Speed Cubers" documentary.
*   **Red Bull:** Sponsors cubing events.
*   **Max Park:** An autistic speedcuber who holds nearly every world record, proving that the cube is a universal language.
