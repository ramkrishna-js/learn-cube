If you buy a cube today, it will likely have the **Standard Color Scheme**. But it wasn't always this way.

## The Standard (BOY) Scheme
*   **B**lue opposite **G**reen.
*   **O**range opposite **R**ed.
*   **Y**ellow opposite **W**hite.
*   *Order:* If White is Top, Blue is Front -> Red is Right. (Blue-Red-Yellow goes clockwise).

## The Japanese Scheme
Used in older cubes (original Rubik's) and some Japanese speedcubes.
*   **Blue opposite White.**
*   **Green opposite Yellow.**
*   *Why?* It mimics the color temperature (Cool colors opposite Warm colors).
*   *Warning:* If you buy a vintage cube, your recognition will be destroyed.

## The "Void" Scheme
Some budget cubes just put random stickers anywhere.
*   **Result:** Impossible to solve if you rely on knowing "Red is always right of Blue".

## Custom Shades
Pro cubers care deeply about the *shade* of the color.
*   **Fluorescent Green:** Easier to see in bad lighting.
*   **Sky Blue vs. Deep Blue:** Preference.
*   **Full Brights:** A sticker set where every color is neon. Looks radioactive.

## Color Neutrality (Again)
If you are color neutral, the scheme matters 10x more. You rely on the relative position of colors (e.g., "Red is always adjacent to Green"). If you switch schemes, your brain breaks.
