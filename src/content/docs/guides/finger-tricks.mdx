If you turn the cube by grabbing the whole side with your entire hand and rotating your wrist 90 degrees... stop. We need to talk.

Speedcubing is 10% brain and 90% muscle memory. Here is how to handle your cube without looking like you're opening a pickle jar.

## The Home Grip
Thumbs on the front (F) face, middle/ring fingers on the back (B) face. This is your neutral stance. Be ready to strike.

## The Triggers

### The Index Flick (U and U')
*   **U (Top Clockwise):** Use your **Right Index Finger** to pull the top-right corner back.
*   **U' (Top Counter-Clockwise):** Use your **Left Index Finger** to pull the top-left corner back.

### The Sexy Move (Trigger)
This is the bread and butter of cubing.

<Algorithm formula="R U R' U'" />

1.  **R:** Turn right side up with wrist.
2.  **U:** Flick top with Right Index.
3.  **R':** Turn right side down with wrist.
4.  **U':** Flick top with Left Index.

Practice this until you can do it without thinking. It should sound like one fluid motion: *trrr-click*.

## Double Flicks (U2)
Need to turn the top twice? Don't flick... pause... flick.
Use your **Index** finger then your **Middle** finger in one rapid 1-2 combo.
*   *Right Index* -> *Right Middle* = **U2**

## The Ring Finger Drag (D)
The bottom layer is the neglected child of finger tricks.
Use your **Ring Finger** (Left or Right) to push the bottom layer. It feels weird at first, like trying to wiggle your ears, but you'll get used to it.

## When to Regrip?
Ideally? Never.
Realistically? When your fingers are twisted into a pretzel.
Minimize regrips by using different fingers. If your right thumb is busy, use your left index. Adapt. Overcome.

## Common Mistakes
1.  **The Wrist Turn:** Turning `U` by rotating your whole hand. Slow.
2.  **The Table Slam:** Solving so hard you slam the cube down. Breaks the table, breaks the cube, scares the cat.
3.  **The Death Grip:** Holding the cube so tight the pieces can't move. Relax. It's a toy, not a grenade.
