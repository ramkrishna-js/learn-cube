Is your cube crunchy? Is there sand in it? (Why did you take it to the beach?). Here is how to take care of your main.

## 1. Tensioning
Most modern cubes have screws or adjustment systems under the center caps.
*   **Too Tight:** Hard to turn, but stable.
*   **Too Loose:** Fast, but might "pop" (pieces fly out).
*   **The Sweet Spot:** It should cut corners at 45 degrees but not fall apart.

## 2. Cleaning
Dust and dead skin (gross, but true) build up inside the cube, creating a black sludge.
1.  **Take it apart:** Turn a layer 45 degrees and pry out an edge piece.
2.  **Wipe it down:** Use a dry paper towel or microfiber cloth.
3.  **Toothbrush:** Use an old dry toothbrush to scrub the tracks.

## 3. Lubricating (Lube)
Once clean, it will feel dry and scratchy.
1.  **Core Lube:** Put a drop of heavy silicone lube (Weight 5) on the screws/springs to stop squeaking.
2.  **Piece Lube:** Put 2 drops of medium lube (like Martian or Silk) on the internal tracks.
3.  **Break in:** Scramble it for 5 minutes to spread the lube.

## 4. Troubleshooting
*   **Spring Noise:** Sounds like a squeaky bed. Needs core lube.
*   **Sand feeling:** Needs cleaning.
*   **Sticky:** Too much lube. Wipe some off.
