If your cube creaks like a haunted house and requires the strength of a Greek god to turn, you need an upgrade. Speedcubing hardware has evolved rapidly.

## Stickerless vs. Stickered
*   **Stickered:** Classic black plastic with colored stickers. Looks cool, but stickers chip and fall off.
*   **Stickerless:** The plastic itself is colored.
    *   **Verdict:** Go **Stickerless**. It lasts forever, and you can't cheat by peeling stickers (we know you thought about it).

## Magnets are Mandatory
Modern speedcubes have small magnets inside the pieces.
*   **Why?** They help the layers "snap" into place after a turn. This reduces lockups and makes the cube feel stable.
*   **Rule:** If it doesn't have magnets, don't buy it. Even budget magnetic cubes ($6) are better than expensive non-magnetic ones from 2015.

## Fancy Tech Terms

### MagLev (Magnetic Levitation)
Instead of metal springs pushing the center caps down, they use two repelling magnets.
*   **Feel:** Extremely fast, zero friction noise.
*   **Worth it?** Yes, if you have the budget. No, if you are just starting.

### Core Magnets
Magnets connecting the corner pieces directly to the core (the ball inside).
*   **Feel:** Adds a "magnetic pull" that auto-completes the turn for you.
*   **Verdict:** Premium feature. Feels amazing, costs extra.

### UV Coating
A glossy, grippy clear coat on the outside.
*   **Pros:** Looks shiny, sticks to your fingers better.
*   **Cons:** Fingerprint magnet.

## Lubrication (Lube)
**DO NOT USE WD-40.** It melts plastic. You will destroy your cube.

Use specialized silicone-based cube lubricants (like generic silicone oil or branded ones like "Lunar", "Silk", "Martian").
*   **Thin Lube:** Makes the cube faster.
*   **Thick Lube:** Makes the cube more controllable and smooth.

## Brand Recommendations (2025 Edition)

### The "I have $10" Tier
*   **MoYu RS3M V5:** The king of budget cubes. It performs like a $50 cube.
*   **QiYi M Pro:** Solid, reliable, cheap.

### The "I want something nice" Tier ($20-$40)
*   **Dayan Guhong Pro:** Maglev, auto-aligning, very light.
*   **WRM V9:** Ridiculously fast. Hold on tight.

### The "Money is no object" Tier ($60+)
*   **GAN 14 Maglev UV:** The iPhone of cubes. Infinite adjustment settings. Comes in a white jewelry box.
*   **MoYu Super Weilong:** Does it come with a watch? No, but it costs as much as one.
