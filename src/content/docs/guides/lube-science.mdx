Putting "Lube" in a puzzle sounds weird to outsiders. To us, it is chemistry.
The wrong lube can ruin a $60 cube.

## The Chemistry

### 1. Silicone Based (The Standard)
Most cube lubes are Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).
*   **Properties:** Doesn't evaporate, doesn't eat plastic, stays slippery forever.
*   **Viscosity (cSt):** Measured in Centistokes.
    *   **100 cSt:** Like water. Extremely fast. (e.g., DNM-37, Stardust).
    *   **500 cSt:** Like olive oil. Balanced.
    *   **50,000 cSt:** Like honey. Very slow, controllable, gummy. (e.g., Traxxas 50k, Nebula).

### 2. Water Based
*   **Properties:** Extremely fast "rush", but evaporates in 2 days.
*   **Use case:** Competition day boost.
*   **Warning:** Can rust the metal screws/springs if you aren't careful.

### 3. Aloe Vera?
*   Yes, some "eco" lubes use plant bases. They feel unique (plush/soft) but can dry out weirdly.

## Where to apply?

### The Tracks (Plastic on Plastic)
*   **Goal:** Speed and Smoothness.
*   **Use:** Thin silicone (Lunar, Martian).
*   **Amount:** 2 drops. Break in.

### The Core (Metal on Plastic)
*   **Goal:** Silence spring noise and reduce friction.
*   **Use:** Heavy, thick silicone (Weight 5, Traxxas 50k).
*   **Amount:** A tiny dab on the washer/spring.

## What NOT to use
*   **WD-40:** It is a solvent. It melts ABS plastic. Your cube will fuse into a brick.
*   **Cooking Oil:** It goes rancid. Your cube will smell like rotting french fries.
*   **Vaseline:** It eats plastic over time (petroleum jelly).

## Setup Recipes
*   **"The Speedy":** Lunar (Tracks) + Stardust (Surface).
*   **"The Control":** Nebula (Tracks) + Weight 5 (Core).
*   **"The Gummy":** Vortex (Tracks). Feels like moving through buttery mud.
