If you just sit there and solve the cube 100 times a day, you will get faster... very slowly. To improve rapidly, you need **Deliberate Practice**.

## 1. Lookahead Drills
"Lookahead" is the art of tracking pieces while your hands are busy solving others.

### The Metronome Drill
1.  Download a Metronome app.
2.  Set it to **60 BPM** (1 beat per second).
3.  Make **one turn** for every click.
    *   *Goal:* NEVER stop turning.
    *   *Result:* Your brain is forced to find the next piece *during* the current turn.
4.  Gradually increase speed (2 turns per beat, etc.).

### Slow Turning
Solve the cube as slowly as possible, but **without pausing**.
*   If you stop, you fail.
*   Your hands should move like a Tai Chi master. Continuous, fluid motion.

### Blind Cross
1.  Inspect the scramble.
2.  Plan your entire Cross (4-6 moves).
3.  **Close your eyes.**
4.  Execute the cross.
5.  Open your eyes. Did you do it?

## 2. Color Neutrality
Most beginners only solve the **White Cross**. This limits you.
*   **Goal:** Be able to start on ANY color (Yellow, Red, Blue, etc.).
*   **Why?** Sometimes the White cross takes 8 moves, but the Blue cross takes only 3 moves.
*   **How to start:** Become "Dual Color Neutral" (White/Yellow) first. Then add Red/Orange, then Blue/Green.

## 3. Algorithm Drilling
Don't just solve. Drill your algos.
1.  Pick an algorithm (e.g., T-Perm).
2.  Do it as fast as you can.
3.  Repeat it 10 times in a row.
4.  Check if you messed up the cube.

## 4. The "2-Gen" Scramble
Scramble the cube using ONLY **R** and **U** moves.
*   Now solve it using only **R** and **U** moves.
*   This trains your "RU-Gen" finger tricks and pattern recognition.
