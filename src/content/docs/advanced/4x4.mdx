The 4x4 (Rubik's Revenge) is the big brother of the 3x3. It has no fixed centers, which introduces a world of pain called "Parity".

## The Method: Reduction (Yau)

We don't solve it layer-by-layer. We turn it into a 3x3 first.

### Step 1: Centers
Since centers move, you must build them.
*   **Goal:** Create 6 solid colored squares in the middle.
*   **Rule:** You must memorize the color order (White opposite Yellow, Blue opposite Green, Red opposite Orange). If you get this wrong, the cube becomes unsolvable.

### Step 2: Edge Pairing
The 4x4 has two pieces for every single edge.
*   **Goal:** Find matching pairs (e.g., two Red-Blue pieces) and join them together.
*   **Result:** You now have 12 "Big Edges".

### Step 3: 3x3 Stage
Now treat the 2x2 blocks as corners, the paired edges as single edges, and the 2x2 centers as single centers. Solve it exactly like a 3x3!

## The Boss Fight: Parity
Sometimes, the 3x3 stage is impossible. This is **Parity**. It happens because hidden internal pieces are swapped.

### OLL Parity (Flipped Edge)
One single edge group is flipped upside down. Impossible on a 3x3.
*   **The Algo:** `Rw U2 x Rw U2 Rw U2 Rw' U2 Lw U2 Rw' U2 Rw U2 Rw' U2 Rw'`
*   *Translation:* Spin the inner layers until your hands hurt.

### PLL Parity (Swapped Edges)
Two edges are swapped, but corners are solved.
*   **The Algo:** `r2 U2 r2 Uw2 r2 Uw2`
*   *Translation:* Much easier. Just slice and spin.
