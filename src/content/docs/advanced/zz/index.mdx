**ZZ (Zbigniew Zborowski)** is the third "Big" method. It is famous for being **Rotationless** (no `x`, `y`, or `z` turns).

## The Philosophy
In CFOP, you rotate the cube constantly to find F2L pairs. In ZZ, we fix all the "Bad Edges" at the very beginning so we *never* have to rotate.

## The Steps

### 1. EOLine (Edge Orientation + Line)
This is the hardest part.
1.  **EO:** Identify all "Bad Edges" (edges that would require a rotation to solve). Flip them using `F` or `B` moves.
2.  **Line:** Solve the Front-Bottom and Back-Bottom edges to create a line.
*   *Result:* The cube can now be solved using only **R, U, L, D** moves. No rotations!

### 2. ZZF2L (F2L)
Solve the Left and Right 1x2x3 blocks.
*   Because all edges are oriented, you just turn L/U/R. No cube rotations needed. It flows incredibly fast.

### 3. ZBLL (Last Layer)
Since edges are already oriented (from Step 1), you skip the "Cross" step of OLL.
*   You can use standard OLL/PLL.
*   Or learn **ZBLL** (493 algorithms) to solve the entire last layer in ONE step.

## Pros & Cons
*   **Pros:** Zero rotations, great for One-Handed, very efficient.
*   **Cons:** EOLine is very hard to inspect in 15 seconds.
