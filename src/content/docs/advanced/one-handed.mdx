One-Handed solving is exactly what it sounds like. It's an official WCA event.

## Why?
1.  It looks incredibly cool.
2.  You can eat a sandwich with the other hand.
3.  It improves your lookahead for two-handed solving.

## The Technique

### 1. The Table Abuse
You are allowed to use the table to align the cube (especially for `R` and `L` moves), but you cannot touch the table to hold the cube steady while turning.

### 2. Pinky Power
Your pinky finger becomes the MVP. It does the `R'` and `D` moves.
*   **R' (Right Down):** Pull the back-right corner down with your pinky.

### 3. RU-Gen
You want to avoid `F` (Front) and `B` (Back) moves because they are awkward one-handed.
*   **Tip:** Rotate the cube (`y` or `y'`) so you only use `R` and `U` moves (Right and Top layers). These are the easiest to turn with one hand.

## Hardware
Use a smaller cube (54mm or 50mm) if you have small hands. Most standard cubes are 55-56mm, which can be tiring for OH.
