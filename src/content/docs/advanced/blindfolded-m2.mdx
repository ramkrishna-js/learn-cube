The **Old Pochmann (OP)** method is great for beginners, but swapping pieces with T-Perms (14 moves) is slow.
Enter **M2**. It solves edges in just... 1 move. (Well, mostly).

## The Concept
*   **Buffer:** DF (Down-Front).
*   **Target:** Wherever the piece belongs.
*   **The Move:** `M2`.
    *   `M2` swaps the DF (Buffer) with the UB (Up-Back) position.

## How it works
1.  **Setup:** Move your target piece to the **UB** position.
2.  **Swap:** Do `M2`.
3.  **Undo Setup:** Move the piece back.

*Example:* To shoot to the **UF** (Up-Front) sticker.
*   **Setup:** `U2` (Moves UF to UB).
*   **Swap:** `M2`.
*   **Undo:** `U2`.
*   *Full Alg:* `U2 M2 U2`.

## Special Cases
The M-slice pieces are tricky because `M2` moves them.
*   **FU (Front-Up):** `F E R U R' E' R U' R' F' M2` (Just memorize it).
*   **BD (Back-Down):** `M2 D R' U R' U' M' U R U' M R D'`.

## Parity
If you have an odd number of edge targets, you have Parity.
*   **Fix:** After finishing edges, do `D' L2 D M2 D' L2 D`. Then solve corners.

## Why learn M2?
*   It reduces execution time by ~50%.
*   It flows much better (less lockups).
*   It's the stepping stone to **3-Style** (the method World Record holders use).
