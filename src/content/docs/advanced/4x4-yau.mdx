Standard Reduction is fine for beginners. But if you want to be fast, you need **Yau**.
Named after Robert Yau, this method solves the "Cross" earlier to improve lookahead.

## The Steps

### 1. First Two Centers
Solve the White and Yellow centers (Opposites).
*   *Just like Reduction.*

### 2. First 3 Cross Edges
**This is the key difference.**
Before solving the other 4 centers, you solve **3 of the White Cross edges**.
*   Place them in their spots relative to the White center.
*   *Why?* Now you have a frame of reference for the rest of the solve.

### 3. Last 4 Centers
Solve the remaining centers (Blue, Red, Green, Orange).
*   *Benefit:* You don't need to look at the bottom (White) or top (Yellow). You can turn the outer layers freely (`u` moves) without breaking your cross edges.

### 4. Last Cross Edge
Solve the final White Cross edge and put it in place.
*   Now your Cross is done!

### 5. Edge Pairing (3-2-3 Pairing)
Use slice moves (`Uw`) to pair up the remaining edges.
*   Since the Cross is done, you don't look at the bottom.
*   You only care about the top and middle layers.

### 6. 3x3 Stage
Solve as a 3x3.
*   *Benefit:* You enter 3x3 stage with the Cross already solved. You go straight to F2L.

## Why Yau?
*   **Lookahead:** In Reduction, finding edges is chaos. In Yau, you narrow the search field.
*   **Rotationless:** You barely rotate the cube during the center/edge stage.
*   **Cross Transition:** You hit the 3x3 stage running.
