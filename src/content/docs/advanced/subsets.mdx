You've mastered CFOP. Now you want to learn more. Welcome to the alphabet soup of advanced subsets.

## ZBLL (Zborowski-Bruchem Last Layer)
*   **What:** Solves the ENTIRE Last Layer (OLL + PLL) in one step.
*   **Condition:** Edges must already be oriented (Cross solved).
*   **Count:** 493 Algorithms.
*   **Sanity Cost:** High.
*   **Who uses it:** Tymon Kolasiński, Yiheng Wang.

## VLS (Valk Last Slot)
*   **What:** Solves the last F2L pair AND the OLL in one step.
*   **Includes:** Winter Variation (WV), Summer Variation (SV).
*   **Count:** Hundreds.
*   **Usefulness:** Moderate. Usually, just learning WV is enough.

## OLLCP (OLL + Corner Permutation)
*   **What:** Solves OLL while forcing a specific PLL (usually skipping diagonal swaps like Y-Perm or E-Perm).
*   **Count:** ~300.

## 1-Look Last Layer (1LLL)
*   **What:** Solve OLL and PLL in one step, regardless of edge orientation.
*   **Count:** 3,915 Algorithms.
*   **Status:** Impossible for humans to master completely. (Though some mad lads are trying).

## Recommendation
Don't try to learn ZBLL yet. Master **COLL** first. It's the gateway drug to ZBLL.
