Beginners solve the cross piece-by-piece. Pros solve the cross as a **system**.
The WCA limit for inspection is 15 seconds. You should use ALL of it to plan your cross.

## 1. Relative Order
You don't need to match the centers immediately.
*   *Scenario:* You have Blue on Front. You put the Red edge on the Left and Orange on the Right.
*   *Fix:* Just do a `D2` at the end.
*   **Rule:** Know your color order (Blue is opposite Green, Red opposite Orange). As long as they are correct *relative to each other*, you can align them at the very end.

## 2. "Bad" vs "Good" Edges
*   **Good Edge:** Can be solved with just `R` or `L` moves into the bottom.
*   **Bad Edge:** Requires `F` or `B` moves (which are slow).
*   **Strategy:** Use the solution of one edge to turn a "Bad" edge into a "Good" one.

## 3. Fingertricks
*   Avoid rotations (`y`) during Cross.
*   Use your left index push for `U'` or right index push for `U` to align the D-layer if needed.
*   Use "Thumb" moves for `F` turns.

## Example
Scramble: `R U R' F'` (Assume White top, Green front).
*   **Beginner:** "Where is Green? Okay put it in. Where is Red? Rotate. Put it in."
*   **Advanced:** "I see Green is good. Red is bad. If I move Green (`R`), Red becomes good (`F`)."

## The Benchmark
If your cross takes more than **8 moves**, you missed a better solution. (Average optimized cross is ~6 moves).
