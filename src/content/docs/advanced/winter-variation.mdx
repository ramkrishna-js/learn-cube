import { Algorithm } from '../../../components/MoveVisualizer.tsx';

**Winter Variation (WV)** is a subset of algorithms used during the **Last Slot** of F2L.
*   **Scenario:** You have a F2L pair made, but the corner is currently *twisted* in the top layer.
*   **Goal:** Insert the pair AND solve the OLL (Top Face) simultaneously.

## Why learn it?
*   **Normal:** Insert Pair (3 moves) -> OLL (9 moves) -> PLL.
*   **WV:** WV Alg (7 moves) -> PLL.
*   **Savings:** You skip an entire step. It feels like magic.

## Prerequisite
*   You must have the **Last Pair** ready to insert.
*   All other F2L slots must be solved.
*   The Top Cross edges must be oriented (EO).

## Common Cases (Right Slot)

### 1. WV 1 (Standard Insert)
If all top corners are already yellow.
<Algorithm formula="U R U' R'" />
*(This is just a normal insert).*

### 2. WV 3 (Sune Shape)
Corner facing Front.
<Algorithm formula="U R U' R' U' R U' R'" />
*(It looks like you are messing up, but trust the process).*

### 3. WV 4 (Anti-Sune Shape)
Corner facing Right.
<Algorithm formula="R U R' U' R U R'" />
*(Sexy move + Insert).*

### 4. WV 5 (Headlights)
Corners facing Front and Back.
<Algorithm formula="R U' R' U R U2 R'" />

## How to Practice
Don't learn all 27 cases at once. Start with the easy ones (Sexy Move variants).
Whenever you have a pair ready to insert, PAUSE. Look at the top corners. Is there an easy case?
