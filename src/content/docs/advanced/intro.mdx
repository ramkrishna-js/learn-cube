Once you can solve the Rubik's Cube confidently using the Beginner Method, you might wonder: "How do people solve this in under 10 seconds?"

The answer lies in **efficiency**. The Beginner Method solves the cube piece by piece (Cross -> Corners -> Middle Edges -> Top Cross -> Top Edges -> Top Corners). Speedcubing methods combine steps and use more algorithms to reduce the total move count.

## The Big Two

### CFOP (Fridrich Method)
Used by the vast majority of top speedcubers (Feliks Zemdegs, Max Park).
*   **Style:** Layer-by-Layer.
*   **Steps:** Cross, F2L (First 2 Layers), OLL (Orientation), PLL (Permutation).
*   **Pros:** Easy transition from Beginner Method, high turn-per-second potential.
*   **Cons:** Lots of algorithms to learn (78 total for full CFOP).

### Roux Method
A different approach invented by Gilles Roux.
*   **Style:** Block Building.
*   **Steps:** First Block, Second Block, CMLL (Corners), LSE (Last Six Edges).
*   **Pros:** Fewer moves (efficiency), slice moves (M) are fast, intuitive.
*   **Cons:** Harder to grasp initially, requires good lookahead.

## Which should I choose?

*   **Choose CFOP if:** You like algorithms, you want to build on what you already know, and you want abundant resources.
*   **Choose Roux if:** You prefer intuition over memorization, you like "M" slice moves, and you want to solve efficiently with fewer turns.
