There are 57 OLLs. Learning them randomly is a recipe for madness. Learn them by **Shape**.

## 1. All Edges Oriented (The Cross) - 7 Algs
You already know these from 2-Look OLL.
*   **Sune:** `R U R' U R U2 R'`
*   **Anti-Sune:** `R U2 R' U' R U' R'`
*   **Headlights:** `R2 D R' U2 R D' R' U2 R'`

## 2. No Edges Oriented (The Dot) - 8 Algs
Everyone hates these. If you get a dot, you messed up your edge control.
*   **Double Sledge:** `R' F R F' U2 R' F R F'`
*   **The "Y" Shape:** `F R U R' U' F' f R U R' U' f'` (F-Sexy + f-Sexy).

## 3. "T" Shapes - 2 Algs
Looks like a T.
*   **Standard T:** `F R U R' U' F'` (You know this one).
*   **Fat T:** `r U R' U' r' F R F'`

## 4. "P" Shapes - 4 Algs
Looks like the letter P.
*   **Standard P:** `f R U R' U' f'`
*   **Inverse P:** `R' U' F' U F R`

## 5. "C" Shapes - 2 Algs
Looks like a C or a [ bracket.
*   **Standard C:** `R U R2 U' R' F R U R U' F'`

## 6. "L" Shapes - 4 Algs
*   **Standard L:** `F R U R' U' R U R' U' F'` (Double Sexy + F).

## 7. Square Shapes - 2 Algs
*   **Square:** `r U2 R' U' R U' r'`

## 8. Lightning Bolts - 4 Algs
*   **Wide Bolt:** `r U R' U R U2 r'` (Fat Sune).

## Learning Order
1.  **Cross Cases** (Essential).
2.  **T, P, Square** (Easy recognition).
3.  **Dot Cases** (To avoid panic).
4.  **The rest** (Lightning, Knight, Fish, Akward).
