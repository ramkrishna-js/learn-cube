**CFOP** stands for the four steps of the method:
1.  **C**ross
2.  **F**2L (First 2 Layers)
3.  **O**LL (Orientation of Last Layer)
4.  **P**LL (Permutation of Last Layer)

It is essentially a streamlined version of the Beginner Method.

## The Differences

| Step | Beginner Method | CFOP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cross** | On Top (Daisy) -> Bottom | Directly on Bottom |
| **Layers 1 & 2** | Corners, then Edges (2 steps) | **F2L:** Corner & Edge Pair together (1 step) |
| **Top Face** | Cross, then Edges, then Corners | **OLL:** Solve entire face in 1 algorithm |
| **Final Layer** | Position Corners, then Twist | **PLL:** Permute all pieces in 1 algorithm |

## Learning Path

Don't try to learn all 78 algorithms at once!
1.  **Intuitive F2L:** Learn to pair pieces logically.
2.  **2-Look OLL:** Solve the top face in 2 steps (Cross + Corners).
3.  **2-Look PLL:** Solve the last layer in 2 steps (Corners + Edges).
4.  **Full CFOP:** Gradually learn the rest.
