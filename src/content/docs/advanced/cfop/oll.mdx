**OLL** makes the entire top face Yellow. It doesn't matter if the side colors match yet.

## 2-Look OLL

Instead of learning 57 algorithms, beginners should learn "2-Look OLL":
1.  **Edge Orientation:** Make the Yellow Cross (same as Beginner Method).
2.  **Corner Orientation:** Twist the corners to be yellow.

### Step 1: The Cross
Use `F R U R' U' F'` (Line) or `F U R U' R' F'` (L-shape) to get the cross.

### Step 2: The Corners (7 Cases)
Once you have the cross, there are only 7 possible corner patterns. Here are the most common two ("Sune" and "Anti-Sune").

#### Sune (Fish shape, correct corner at front-left)
<Algorithm formula="R U R' U R U2 R'" />

#### Anti-Sune (Fish shape, correct corner at back-right)
<Algorithm formula="R U2 R' U' R U' R'" />

#### Headlights (Two yellow stickers facing front)
<Algorithm formula="R2 D R' U2 R D' R' U2 R'" />

#### Chameleon (Two yellow stickers facing out sides)
<Algorithm formula="r U R' U' r' F R F'" />

*(Note: `r` means turn the right two layers).*
