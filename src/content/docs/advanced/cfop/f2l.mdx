In the beginner method, we solved the white corners, then the middle edges. In **F2L**, we solve both at the same time by creating a "Pair" and inserting it into the slot.

## The Logic: Split & Pair

The core skill of F2L is not memorizing algorithms. It is **intuitive manipulation**.
You have two pieces (Corner + Edge). You want them to be stuck together correctly, then dropped into their home.

### The "Splitting" Technique
Often, your pieces are stuck together incorrectly (e.g., checking board pattern).
To fix this, you must **"Hide the Corner"**.

1.  Move the corner to the bottom layer (temporarily).
2.  While it's hidden, the top layer is free to spin!
3.  Move the edge piece to a better spot.
4.  Bring the corner back up.

:::tip[Golden Rule]
Never hide a piece if it breaks a "Solved Pair" or your "Cross". Only hide using "Empty Slots" (slots that aren't solved yet).

## The 3 Fundamental Cases

Most F2L cases reduce to one of these three scenarios.

### Case 1: Easy Pair (Different Colors on Top)
The corner and edge are touching or near each other, and the top colors are different.
*   **Goal:** Pull them together to form a block.

<Algorithm formula="R U R'" />

### Case 2: Split Pair (Same Colors on Top)
The corner and edge have the same color facing up.
*   **Goal:** You want them to be **far apart** on the top layer.
*   **Action:** Hide corner -> Move edge away -> Restore corner.

<Algorithm formula="R U2 R' U' R U R'" />

### Case 3: White Sticker Facing Up
The corner has white facing up. This is annoying.
*   **Goal:** Knock the white sticker to the side.
*   **Action:** Align edge with center -> Turn side to hide edge -> Move corner on top of edge -> Restore side.

<Algorithm formula="R U2 R' U' R U R'" />

## Pro Tip: Lookahead
The secret to F2L speed isn't turning fast. It's **never stopping**.
While your hands are solving Pair #1, your eyes should NOT be watching Pair #1. They should be hunting for **Pair #2**.

*   Don't watch what you are doing. Trust your muscle memory.
*   Scan the top layer for the next Red/Blue edge while solving Orange/Green.
