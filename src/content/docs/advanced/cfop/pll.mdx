**PLL** moves the pieces around to their correct spots while keeping them yellow facing up.

## 2-Look PLL

We break this into two steps:
1.  **Corners:** Put all corners in the right place.
2.  **Edges:** Put all edges in the right place.

### Step 1: Corners
Look for "Headlights" (two same-colored corner stickers on one side).
*   **If you have headlights:** Put them at the **Back** and do the **T-Perm** (or A-Perm).
*   **If no headlights:** Do the **Y-Perm** (or T-Perm from anywhere).

#### T-Perm (The most useful algo!)
<Algorithm formula="R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'" />

### Step 2: Edges
Now only edges are swapped.

#### Ua-Perm (Cycle 3 edges clockwise)
One edge is solved (put at Back).

<Algorithm formula="R U' R U R U R U' R' U' R2" />

#### Ub-Perm (Cycle 3 edges counter-clockwise)
One edge is solved (put at Back).

<Algorithm formula="R2 U R U R' U' R' U' R' U R'" />

#### H-Perm (Swap Opposite Edges)
All edges are wrong.

<Algorithm formula="M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2" />

#### Z-Perm (Swap Adjacent Edges)

<Algorithm formula="M2 U M2 U M' U2 M2 U2 M'" />

*(Note: `M` is the middle slice turn).*
