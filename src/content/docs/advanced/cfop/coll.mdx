**COLL (Corners of Last Layer)** is a subset of OLL.
*   **Prerequisite:** All Edges are already oriented (The Cross is solved).
*   **Goal:** Solve the Top Corners (Orientation) AND their Permutation (Placement) at the same time.

## Why learn it?
*   **Normal OLL:** Orients corners -> Leaves you with ANY of the 21 PLLs (including the bad ones like G-Perms).
*   **COLL:** Orients corners + Permutes them -> Leaves you with only **EPLL** (Edge Permutation Last Layer).
    *   EPLLs are the fastest PLLs: **U-Perm, H-Perm, Z-Perm**.
    *   Result: You guarantee an easy finish.

## Recognition
You recognize COLL by looking at the "Headlights" or matching colors on the top layer *before* you do the alg.

## Example: The "H" Case
(Top has Cross, two headlights front, two headlights back).
*   **Standard OLL:** `R U R' U R U' R' U R U2 R'` -> Gives random PLL.
*   **COLL (Columns Case):** If the front two corners have the same side colors...
    *   Alg: `R U R' U R U L' U R' U' L`
    *   Result: Solved corners. You skip corner PLL.

There are about 40 COLL algorithms. It is a great step after you master full CFOP.
