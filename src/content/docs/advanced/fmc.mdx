Most events are about **Time**. FMC is about **Efficiency**.
You are given a scramble and **1 hour**. You must find the shortest solution possible.

## The Rules
*   You get paper, pencils, and 3 cubes.
*   You write down your solution in notation.
*   Result = Total number of moves. (World Class is < 25 moves).

## Basic Techniques

### 1. Blockbuilding (Petrus/Heise style)
CFOP is inefficient (usually 60 moves).
In FMC, we build blocks.
*   **2x2x2 Block:** Solve a corner and its 3 surrounding edges.
*   **2x2x3 Block:** Expand it.
*   This is far more efficient than Cross + F2L.

### 2. NISS (Normal Inverse Scramble Switch)
This is dark magic.
*   If the scramble is bad, you can solve the **Inverse Scramble** (the scramble played backwards).
*   Why? A solution to the inverse scramble is just the inverse of the normal solution.
*   You can switch between Normal and Inverse scrambles mid-solve to find better block continuations.

### 3. Insertions
You solve the cube *except* for 3 corners (a "Skeleton").
Then, you go back inside your solution and insert a **Commutator** at the exact right moment to solve those corners, canceling out moves.

## Example of Efficiency
*   **CFOP Solver:** `R U R' U'` (4 moves) to pair.
*   **FMC Solver:** Uses the scramble's pre-existing blocks to solve the pair in 1 move.
