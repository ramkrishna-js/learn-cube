**Roux** relies less on algorithms and more on freedom of movement. It uses the `M` slice (middle layer) heavily.

## The 4 Steps

### 1. First Block (FB)
Build a 1x2x3 block on the **Left** side.
*   Totally intuitive.
*   You can use the M-slice and U-layer freely.

### 2. Second Block (SB)
Build a 1x2x3 block on the **Right** side.
*   Now the Left and Right sides are solved.
*   The `M` slice and `U` layer are still free to move.

### 3. CMLL (Corners of Last Layer)
Solve the 4 corners of the top layer in one step (Orientation + Permutation).
*   There are 42 algorithms (similar to OLL/PLL but focused on corners).
*   Beginners can use 2-Look CMLL (Orient then Permute).

### 4. LSE (Last Six Edges)
Solve the remaining 6 edges (4 on top, 2 on bottom) using only `M` and `U` moves.
1.  **Orientation:** Flip bad edges so they can be solved.
2.  **UL/UR:** Place the left and right edges.
3.  **Last 4:** Solve the remaining centers and edges.

## Why Roux?
*   **Efficiency:** Average move count is ~48 moves (vs ~60 for CFOP).
*   **Lookahead:** Since you track fewer pieces (blocks instead of cross+pairs), it can be easier to plan ahead.
*   **Table Abuse:** Not great for one-handed, but amazing for two-handed solving.
