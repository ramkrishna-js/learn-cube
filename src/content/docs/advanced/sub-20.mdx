Breaking the 20-second barrier is the "Black Belt" of speedcubing. It separates the casual solvers from the serious speedcubers.

## The Sub-1 Minute Stage
*   **Method:** Beginner Method (Layer by Layer).
*   **Goal:** Just get comfortable with the cube. Stop dropping it.
*   **Drill:** Repeat the algorithms until you don't need the cheat sheet.

## The Sub-40 Stage
*   **Method:** Switch to **CFOP** (4-Look Last Layer).
*   **Cross:** Solve it on the **bottom**. Plan at least 2 pieces during inspection.
*   **F2L:** Stop inserting corner... then edge. Learn **Intuitive F2L**.
*   **Last Layer:** Learn **2-Look OLL** and **2-Look PLL**.

## The Sub-30 Stage
*   **Method:** Efficient CFOP.
*   **Cross:** Plan the entire cross (4 pieces) in inspection.
*   **F2L:** Fix your "bad habits" (regripping, rotating the cube to find pieces).
*   **Drill:** Slow turning. Lookahead is starting to matter.

## The Sub-20 Stage (The Wall)
This is the hardest jump. You know the algorithms, but you aren't fast enough.
*   **Cross:** Done in < 3 seconds.
*   **F2L:** This is 50% of your solve. You need to see the next pair *while* solving the current one.
    *   *Goal:* No pauses between pairs.
*   **Last Layer:** Learn **Full PLL** (21 Algs). You don't *need* Full OLL yet, but it helps.
*   **Hardware:** You need a magnetic cube. No excuses.

## The Sub-10 Stage (God Mode)
*   **Method:** Color Neutrality, Advanced F2L, Full OLL, maybe ZBLL.
*   **Practice:** Hours per day.
*   **Lifestyle:** You dream in algorithms.
