The Last Layer is where beginners get most confused because the patterns look complex. Don't worry, there are only a few distinct states.

## Step 1: Yellow Cross (3 Patterns)
Ignore the corners. Look only at the Yellow Edges.

### 1. The Dot
Only the center is yellow.
<Algorithm formula="F R U R' U' F'" />
*Result: Now you have the "L".*

### 2. The "L" Shape
Two edges make a small L. **Hold it in the Back-Left.**
<Algorithm formula="F U R U' R' F'" />
*Result: The Cross.*

### 3. The Line
A horizontal line.
<Algorithm formula="F R U R' U' F'" />
*Result: The Cross.*

## Step 2: Cross Edges (2 Patterns)
Rotate the top layer to match the side colors of the cross edges.

### 1. Two Adjacent Match (Back & Right)
Common case.
<Algorithm formula="R U R' U R U2 R' U" />

### 2. Two Opposite Match (Front & Back)
Perform the algorithm once from anywhere.
<Algorithm formula="R U R' U R U2 R' U" />
*Result: Now two adjacent will match. Re-align and do it again.*

---

## Step 3: Corner Position (2 Patterns)
Check if corners are in the correct slot (colors match centers), even if twisted.

### 1. None Correct
Do the algorithm from anywhere.
<Algorithm formula="U R U' L' U R' U' L" />

### 2. One Correct
Hold it in **Front-Right**. Do the algorithm.
<Algorithm formula="U R U' L' U R' U' L" />
*(Repeat if necessary).*

## Step 4: Twist Corners (7 Patterns)
You will see one of these shapes. The solution is ALWAYS the same: **`R' D' R D`**.
*   **Crucial:** Do not rotate the cube. Use `U` moves to bring the next corner to Front-Right.

### 1. Sune (Fish)
One corner solved, 3 twisted counter-clockwise.

### 2. Anti-Sune (Fish)
One corner solved, 3 twisted clockwise.

### 3. Headlights
Two corners facing front.

### 4. Chameleon
Two corners facing away (sides).

### 5. Bowtie
Two diagonal corners solved, two wrong.

### 6. Car (H)
Two facing front, two facing back.

### 7. Blinker (Pi)
Two facing front, two facing sides.

**Just remember:** Pick an unsolved corner (Front-Right), do `R' D' R D` until yellow is up, turn Top (`U`), repeat.
