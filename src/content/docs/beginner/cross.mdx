The **White Cross** is the foundation of your solve. The goal is to form a white cross on the bottom face (usually white) where the edge pieces match the center colors of the adjacent faces.

:::tip[Goal]
You want 4 white edges surrounding the white center.
**Crucial:** The side colors of these edges MUST match the center pieces of the side faces (Blue, Red, Green, Orange).

## The Concept: "Daisy" Method

For beginners, it is easiest to start with the **Daisy**. Instead of solving the white cross directly on the white face, we build it on the **Yellow** face first.

### Step 1: Make a Daisy
Ignore the side colors for a moment. Just get 4 white edge stickers surrounding the yellow center.
1. Look for white edge pieces in the middle layer.
2. Rotate the face to bring them up to the yellow face.
3. If an edge is flipped, move it to the side, then bring it up.

*Result: A yellow center with 4 white "petals".*

### Step 2: Match and Turn
Now we transfer the petals to the white face correctly.

1.  Look at the **side color** of one white petal (e.g., Red).
2.  Rotate the top layer (`U`) until that red sticker aligns with the **Red Center**.
3.  Turn that face 180 degrees (`F2` or `R2` etc.) to bring the white edge down to the white face.
4.  Repeat for all 4 petals.

## Common Cases

### Case 1: The "Good" Edge
The white sticker is facing you on the bottom layer.

<Algorithm formula="F2" />

### Case 2: The "Flipped" Edge
The edge is in the right spot but the white sticker is not facing the white center.

<Algorithm formula="F' U L' U'" />

## Check Your Work
Flip your cube over to look at the white face.
*   Do you have a cross?
*   Do the side colors match the centers (e.g. White/Blue edge touches Blue center)?

If yes, congratulations! Move on to the [First Layer](/beginner/first-layer/).
