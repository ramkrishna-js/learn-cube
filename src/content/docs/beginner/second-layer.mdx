You are looking for edges in the **Top Layer** that have **NO Yellow**.

## Top Layer Cases
The edge is in the top layer. You have matched the front color to the center (making a "T").

### Case 1: Moves to the Right
The top sticker matches the Right center.
<Algorithm formula="U R U' R' U' F' U F" />

### Case 2: Moves to the Left
The top sticker matches the Left center.
<Algorithm formula="U' L' U L U F U' F'" />

## The "Stuck" Cases
There are no good edges in the top layer, but the second layer is not done.

### Case 3: Flipped in Place
The edge is in the right spot, but backwards.
*   **Fix:** We must replace it with a "dummy" yellow edge to pop it out.
*   Perform the **Right Algorithm** once:
<Algorithm formula="U R U' R' U' F' U F" />
*   Now the piece is in the top layer. Solve it correctly.

### Case 4: Stuck in Wrong Slot
The edge is in the middle layer, but in the wrong home.
*   **Fix:** Same as above. Perform the **Right Algorithm** to pop it out.
*   Then move it to its correct home.

:::tip[Visual Cue]
If you can't find any non-yellow edges on top, look at the sides. You will see a piece that looks "trapped". You have to "evict" it!
