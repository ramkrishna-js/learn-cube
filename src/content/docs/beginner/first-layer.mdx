You are looking for White Corners in the **Top Layer**. Here is every possible scenario you will face.

## Top Layer Cases
The corner is in the yellow layer, ready to be solved. Position it above its target slot.

### Case 1: White Faces Right
The easiest case.
<Algorithm formula="R U R'" />

### Case 2: White Faces Front
Also easy.
<Algorithm formula="U' R' U' R" />
*(Or use the Left hand: `L' U' L`)*

### Case 3: White Faces Up
The "Sky" case. We need to fix it first.
<Algorithm formula="R U2 R' U' R U R'" />
*(This turns it into Case 1).*

## Bottom Layer Cases (The "Stuck" Ones)
The corner is already in the first layer, but it's wrong.

### Case 4: Twisted in Place
It's in the right slot, but the white sticker is not on the bottom.
*   **Fix:** We must "pop" it out to the top layer first.
<Algorithm formula="R U R' U'" />
*   Now it is in the top layer (Case 1 or 2). Solve normally.

### Case 5: Stuck in Wrong Slot
It's in the bottom layer, but between the wrong centers (e.g., Red/Blue corner is in the Blue/Orange slot).
*   **Fix:** Pop it out.
<Algorithm formula="R U R'" />
*   Now move it to the correct slot and solve.

## Summary Checklist
1.  **Scan Top Layer.** Is there a white corner?
    *   **Yes:** Move it above its home. Check if White faces Right, Front, or Up.
    *   **No:** Look at the Bottom Layer.
2.  **Scan Bottom Layer.** Is there a stuck corner?
    *   **Yes:** Do `R U R'` to bring it to the top.
    *   **No:** You are done!
