The 2x2 might look easy, but it can be tricky. It's essentially a 3x3 without edges or centers—just corners.

## The Method: Ortega
Professional 2x2 solvers use the **Ortega Method**. It has 3 steps.

### Step 1: Face Building
Build one solid face (e.g., White) at the bottom.
*   **Note:** Unlike 3x3, the side colors *don't* need to match yet! Just get all white stickers on the bottom.

### Step 2: OLL (Orient Last Layer)
Make the top face (Yellow) solid.
*   You use the same algorithms as 3x3 corner orientation (Sune, Anti-Sune, Headlights, etc.).

### Step 3: PBL (Permute Both Layers)
This is the magic of Ortega. We solve the side colors of *both* the top and bottom layers at the same time.

#### Case 1: Bar on Bottom, Bar on Top
You have two solved adjacent pieces (a "bar") on the bottom layer and on the top layer.
*   Hold bars at the **Back**.
<Algorithm formula="R2 U' B2 U2 R2 U' R2" />

#### Case 2: No Bars (Diagonal Swap)
No side colors match on top or bottom.
<Algorithm formula="R2 F2 R2" />

#### Case 3: Bar on Bottom, No Bar on Top
<Algorithm formula="R U' R F2 R' U R'" />

*(There are 5 PBL algorithms total, but these cover most cases).*
