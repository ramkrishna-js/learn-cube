The Mastermorphix looks like a pyramid (Tetrahedron), but don't be fooled. It is **mechanically identical to a 3x3**.

## The Deception
*   It has 4 faces, but it has 6 "Centers" (the 4 tips + 4 face centers... wait, math).
*   Actually, the "Centers" are the flat triangles. The "Corners" are the small tips.
*   It changes shape.

## How to Solve
Use the 3x3 Beginner Method, but watch out for:

### 1. Center Orientation
On a normal 3x3, centers don't care which way they rotate. On a Mastermorphix, the centers are two colors. If they are rotated 90 degrees, the puzzle won't look solved.
*   **Fix:** Use standard algorithms to rotate centers.

### 2. Parity?
It's not real parity. It's "False Equivocation".
*   Two identical pieces can be swapped, making it look like a single edge is flipped.
*   **Fix:** Swap two identical pieces to fix the "impossible" state.

## Why solve it?
To prove that you understand *how* a 3x3 works, not just *what* the stickers look like.
