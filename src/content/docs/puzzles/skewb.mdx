The Skewb is weird. It is a corner-turning puzzle. When you turn a corner, half the cube moves.

## Notation
*   **R:** Turn the bottom-right corner (and everything attached) down/back.
*   **r:** Turn the bottom-right corner up/forward.
*   **L:** Turn the bottom-left corner down/back.

## The Sledgehammer
This is the **One Algorithm to Rule Them All**. Master this move.

<Algorithm formula="R' F R F'" />

*(Right down, Left down, Right up, Left up).*

## The Method

### Step 1: First Face
Pick a color (e.g., White) and get all 4 corners to point up.
*   This is intuitive. Just twist them until they match.

### Step 2: Yellow Center
Flip the cube over. The Yellow center is likely somewhere on the sides.
*   Hold the cube so the Yellow center is at the **Back**.
*   Perform: **Sledgehammer x 2**.
*   *Result:* Yellow center is now on top.

### Step 3: Yellow Corners
Now orient the yellow corners.
*   **Headlights:** Hold headlights on the **Right**. Sledgehammer x 2.
*   **Chameleon:** Hold eyes on the **Front**. Sledgehammer x 2.

### Step 4: The H-Perm (Center Swap)
If you have 4 centers wrong (Top/Front and Left/Right need swapping).
*   Algorithm: `Sledgehammer` -> `y2` (rotate 180) -> `Sledgehammer`.
