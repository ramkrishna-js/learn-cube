Rubik's Clock is the black sheep of the WCA. It involves turning gears to point hands at 12 o'clock.

## The Hardware
It has 9 clock faces on the front and 9 on the back. There are 4 pins and 4 wheels.
*   **Pins Up:** The wheel turns the faces around that pin.
*   **Pins Down:** The wheel turns different faces.

## The Method
There is basically only one method: **Point everything to 12.**

### 1. The Cross
Make a cross on one side (center clock + 4 adjacent clocks) point to 12.
*   *Technique:* Hold a pin up, turn a wheel until the center matches the top clock. Put that pin down. Repeat.

### 2. The Flip
Flip the puzzle over. (Yes, really).

### 3. The Cross (Again)
Do the same thing on the back.

### 4. The Corners
Now match the corner clocks to the cross.
*   Turn wheels until they all sync up.
*   Final Step: Turn ANY wheel until everything points to 12.

## Controversy
*   **Haters say:** "It's a 2D puzzle!" "It's ugly!"
*   **Lovers say:** "It's easy to get a world record!" (Spoiler: It is not).
*   **Fact:** A good clock costs $30 (QiYi Clock) and uses magnets. Do not buy the original Rubik's brand; it feels like grinding rocks.
