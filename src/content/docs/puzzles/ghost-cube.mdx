The Ghost Cube is technically a 3x3 shape mod. But calling it a 3x3 is like calling a tiger "basically a house cat."

## Why is it a nightmare?
1.  **Misaligned Layers:** The layers are cut at weird angles. You have to turn them slightly to even make a legal move.
2.  **One Color:** Usually White or Black. You cannot rely on colors. You must rely on unique shapes.
3.  **Parity?** No, but pieces look identical when they aren't. A piece might fit in a slot but be rotated 180 degrees, which blocks the entire puzzle later.

## The Experience
*   **Hour 1:** "Cool, it looks spiky."
*   **Hour 5:** "I have solved the cross. I think."
*   **Hour 20:** "I regret being born."

## How to actually solve it (if you must)
1.  **Ghost Alignment:** You have to align the top and bottom layers so they match the middle layer's strange angle.
2.  **Super-Cube Centers:** The centers have orientation. You have to rotate them correctly.
3.  **Shape Recognition:** You are looking for tiny triangles and weird trapezoids.

## Verdict
Buy it as a trophy. Put it on your shelf. **Never scramble it.**
