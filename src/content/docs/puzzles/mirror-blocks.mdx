The Mirror Cube looks like a silver (or gold) brick. When scrambled, it looks like modern art wreckage.

## The Secret
**Shape = Color.**
*   On a normal cube, you look for the *Red* piece.
*   On a Mirror cube, you look for the *Thickest* piece.

## How to solve it
Use the exact same Beginner Method or CFOP you already know.

### 1. The Cross
Find the center that is the "tallest" (sticks out the most). Find the 4 edges that match its height.
*   *Tip:* Feel with your fingers. If it's flush (smooth), it's correct.

### 2. Corners
Find the corner that fits the gap.
*   *Difficulty:* Visualizing orientation. You can't see "white facing up". You have to look at the shape. If it's tall, it needs to lay down.

### 3. Last Layer
This is the trippy part.
*   **OLL:** You aren't making the top "Yellow". You are making the top "Flat".
*   **PLL:** You are swapping pieces until the sides are flush.

## Why try it?
It forces you to stop relying on color recognition and understand the **geometry** of the pieces. Plus, it looks insanely impressive to non-cubers.
