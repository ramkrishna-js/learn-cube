The Square-1 (Squan) is the only WCA puzzle that changes shape. It will cut your fingers. It will break your brain.

## Notation
Square-1 speaks a different language. It uses **(Top, Bottom)** coordinates and **/** (Slash).
*   **/**: Slice the right half of the puzzle 180 degrees.
*   **(3, 0):** Turn Top layer 30 degrees clockwise (1 big wedge).
*   **(-1, 0):** Turn Top layer 30 degrees counter-clockwise (1 small wedge).

## The Steps (Vandenbergh Method)

### 1. Cubeshape
The puzzle starts looking like a crushed soda can. Your first goal is to make it a cube.
*   *Strategy:* Gather all 8 edges together to form a "Star" or "Scallop" shape, then slash.
*   *Difficulty:* High. If you mess up, you are back to the soda can.

### 2. Corner Orientation (CO)
Make all corners match their face colors.

### 3. Edge Orientation (EO)
Make all edges match their face colors.
*   *Algorithm:* `M2` equivalent on Squan is `(1,0) / (-1,-1) / (0,1)`. Good luck remembering that.

### 4. Corner Permutation (CP)
Put corners in the right spots.
*   We often use an algo that swaps 2 corners on top and 2 on bottom simultaneously (`J/J`).

### 5. Edge Permutation (EP)
Swap the edges.
*   **Parity:** Oh yes. Square-1 has the worst parity of all.
*   *The Parity Alg:* It is terrifyingly long.
    *   ` / (3,3) / (1,0) / (-2,-2) / (2,0) / (2,2) / (-1,0) / (-3,-3) / (-2,0) / (3,3) / (3,0) / (-1,-1) / (-3,0) / (1,1) / (-4,3)`

## Why solve it?
Because you hate yourself? Or maybe because the "Slash" move feels incredibly satisfying, like chopping vegetables.
