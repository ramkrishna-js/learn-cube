Once you solve a 4x4, you can solve a 5x5, 6x6, 7x7, and even a 19x19. The method is always **Reduction**.

## The Hierarchy
*   **Odd Cubes (3x3, 5x5, 7x7):** Have fixed centers. **NO Parity** on the edge-flipping step. Easier.
*   **Even Cubes (2x2, 4x4, 6x6):** No fixed centers. **Have Parity**. Harder.

## 5x5 Walkthrough (The Professor's Cube)

### 1. Centers (9 pieces each)
Solve the 3x3 block in the middle of each face.
*   *Tip:* Solve bars (1x3 lines) and attach them.

### 2. Edge Pairing (3 pieces each)
You need to join the middle edge + two wing edges.
*   Use the **Freeslice Method**: Keep the M-slice free to build edges, then store them in the top/bottom layers.

### 3. 3x3 Stage
Now it is just a giant 3x3.
*   Solve it with CFOP.
*   **Parity?** 5x5 has NO OLL Parity (flipped edge). It *can* have PLL Parity (swapped edges) only in the very last step.

## 6x6 and Beyond
*   **Centers:** Build them from the inside out (1x2 center -> 2x2 -> 2x4 -> 4x4).
*   **Edges:** Use the "Redux" method to pair 4, 5, or 6 edge pieces at a time.
*   **Patience:** A 7x7 solve can take 5-10 minutes for a beginner.
