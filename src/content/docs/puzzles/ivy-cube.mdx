The Ivy Cube (by QiYi) is a Skewb modification. It is arguably the easiest WCA-style puzzle (though not an official event).

## Structure
*   It has leaf-shaped corners and large eye-shaped centers.
*   It turns around the corners (like a Skewb).

## The Method
1.  **Solve the White Face:** Intuitive. Bring the white "Leaf" up to the white center.
2.  **Solve the Yellow Face:** Turn the cube over. Bring yellow up.
3.  **Solve the Belt:** The remaining 4 centers.
    *   **Algorithm:** `R U R' U'` (Sledgehammer-ish).
    *   This cycles 3 centers.

## Why own one?
It turns incredibly smoothly. It's the perfect puzzle to have on your desk to fiddle with while on a Zoom call.
