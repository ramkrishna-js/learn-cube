The 1x1 Cube (also known as "The Die" or "A Block") is the pinnacle of engineering.

## The Mechanism
It features a 0-axis core with infinite stability. It has 0 moving parts, meaning it has a lockup rate of 0%.

## How to Scramble
1.  Pick it up.
2.  There is no step 2. You cannot scramble it. It is immutable. It is eternal.

## The Solution
This is where it gets tricky.
If the 1x1 is sitting on the table with Green facing you... **It is already solved.**

## Advanced Methods
Speedcubers have developed advanced techniques for the 1x1.

### The "Pick Up and Put Down" Method
1.  Lift the puzzle.
2.  Rotate y' (Turn it around).
3.  Place it down.
*   *Note:* Be careful of parity. (Just kidding).

## Why buy one?
To throw at people who ask if you can solve a 10x10.
