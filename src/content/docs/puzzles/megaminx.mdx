The Megaminx is a dodecahedron (12 faces). It looks terrifying, but here is the secret: **It is just a 3x3.**

## The Concept
If you can solve a 3x3, you can solve 95% of a Megaminx.
*   **Centers:** Fixed (just like 3x3).
*   **Edges:** Have 2 colors (just like 3x3).
*   **Corners:** Have 3 colors (just like 3x3).

## The Steps

### 1. The Star (Cross)
Instead of a White Cross (4 edges), you build a **White Star** (5 edges).
*   *Strategy:* Same as 3x3. Find the white edges and match them to their centers.

### 2. First Layer Corners (F2L)
Insert the 5 white corners.
*   *Strategy:* Same as 3x3 (`R U R'`).

### 3. Second Layer Edges
This is where it gets long. You need to solve the edges above the white corners.
*   *Strategy:* Use standard 3x3 edge insertion (`U R U' R' U' F' U F`).

### 4. S2L (Second 2 Layers)
Now you have a "Star" pattern on the bottom. You need to build "Mega-F2L" for every other color around the equator.
*   **Process:** Pick a color (e.g., Red). Build its "Star" legs, then insert its corners/edges. Move to the next color (Blue).
*   *Tip:* Order matters! Go in a circle (Red -> Blue -> Yellow -> Purple -> Green).

### 5. Last Layer (Grey Face)
Now you have one face left (usually Grey).
1.  **Edge Orientation:** Make a Grey Star. (`F R U R' U' F'`).
2.  **Corner Orientation:** Twist corners to be Grey. (`R U R' U R U2 R'`).
3.  **Permutation:** Swap pieces to finish.

## Why is it hard?
It's not hard; it's **endurance**. A 3x3 speedsolve takes 10 seconds. A Megaminx speedsolve takes 1 minute. It requires lookahead and stamina.
