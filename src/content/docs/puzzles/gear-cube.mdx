The Gear Cube looks like a mechanical nightmare. When you turn it, gears spin, slices move, and the whole universe feels mechanical.

## The Secret
It takes **12 turns** to rotate a face 360 degrees.
However, it is surprisingly simple because the gears lock the mechanism. You have very little freedom of movement.

## The Method

### 1. The Corners
Get the corners to match the core.
*   This is intuitive. Just turn until they match.

### 2. Position the Edges
Get the edges to the right spot.
*   `R2 U R2 U` (Repeat until they swap).

### 3. Orientation
The edges might be in the right spot but "flat" instead of "twisted".
*   **The Golden Move:** `R4`.
*   Spin the Right layer 4 times (180 degrees). The gears will spin the edges as they travel.

## Difficulty Rating
**1/10**. It looks like a level 10 boss, but it fights like a level 1 slime.
