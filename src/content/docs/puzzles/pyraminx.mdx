The Pyraminx is a tetrahedron. It's much easier than a 3x3 and very satisfying to turn.

## Anatomy
*   **Tips:** The 4 pointy ends. They do nothing. Just twist them to match the center next to them.
*   **Centers:** The pieces attached to the core.
*   **Edges:** The pieces between centers.

## The Method

### Step 1: The Centers
Turn the tips to match the centers. Then, rotate the 3 layers so that all 3 centers on one face match (e.g., 3 Yellow centers).
*   *Hint:* If you can't get all 3 on one face, you are looking at the wrong face. Pick another side.

### Step 2: Insert Edges (First Layer)
Solve the yellow edges to complete the bottom layer.
*   Use simple logic: Move the slot up, put the edge in, move it down.
*   `R U' R'` or `L' U L`.

### Step 3: Last Layer
You will end up with one of 5 cases.

#### Case 1: The "Headlights" (2 Edges flipped)
Two edges are in the right spot but flipped wrong.
<Algorithm formula="R U R' U' R U R' U'" />
*(Right Down, Top Right, Right Up, Top Left... repeat).*

#### Case 2: The Cycle (3 Edges need to rotate)
One face is solved, the others look like eyes.
<Algorithm formula="R U' R' U' R U' R'" />
