The Redi Cube (designed by Oskar van Deventer) is a corner-turning puzzle where the corners are the only moving parts.

## Mechanism
*   **8 Corners:** Can rotate 120 degrees.
*   **Edges:** They don't move independently; they are moved by the corners.
*   **No Centers:** The "centers" are fixed relative to the core, but hidden.

## The Method
It is entirely intuitive. You can solve it without memorizing a single algorithm.
1.  **Solve the Corners:** Just match the colors.
2.  **Solve the Edges:** Use "Down, Down, Up, Up" (The Commutator) to swap edges around.

## Why it's great
It is impossible to "Pop" (explode) and it is very hard to get a "lockup". It is the perfect stress-relief toy.
